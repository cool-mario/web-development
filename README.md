# web-development

Here are the projects I worked on in the web devlopment class!

**H** - homework  
**X** - exersize
**P** - project

also see `index.html` for links to all the other pages displayed in a nice table!

### Stuff you can find:

php stuff  
javascript stuff
some css


For me, this also serves as a back up in case I accidentally delete all my files on the web server =D
