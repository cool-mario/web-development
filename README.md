# web-development

Here you can find various projects I made for an advanced Web Development class I took in the summer! This class required everyone to have taken APCSA and HTML classes already, so it's pretty advanced. In this class, I learned programming on the frontend and backend (PHP), and database design. We learned how to code in PHP, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, ajax, and more.

You can find stuff I created like games and strange websites. For example, I made a lights-out game using javascript, and you can play it on your phone. (see X4) **`P1`** is my first project, which is a quiz to find out what type of "nerd" you are! I just finished it! (try to break the form, I have backend validation hehehehe)

**`P2`** is our second and final project. In P2, a partner and I work together to create something super cool. We're making a store website right now, where you can create new accounts and log in and buy stuff!! It is the final test of our knowledge!!!
You can create a new account, and log in. from there, blah blah blah...... i know you don't like reading so just go to the separate repository here: [cool-mario/The-Store](https://github.com/cool-mario/The-Store) and see 4 yourself
