        <h2>The Real Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Aidan, and I am a hardworking student who is interested in computer science, machine learning, math and science. Iâ€™ve also done many tech related projects too (see the next section)
            I've started to look into biology and chemistry stuff as well, and because I want to explore potential jobs like dentistry or psychology.

            I joined this class to make new friends, so feel free to talk to me!
            <br>
            In my free time, I like to play video games like Minecraft, and a bunch of different games on the nintendo switch. (mariokart, super smash bros, mario party, etc)

            For college, I was originally thinking about majoring in CS, but seeing that its so competitive, I'm also researching data science and biology related fields.

        <h2>The Tech Me</h2>
        <p>
            I've been interested in computers and technology for a long time. I know Python and Java very well. I also know some javascript, HTML, and CSS. Using python libraries, I can program many things, like machine learning models, and discord chatbots. I have also taken APCSP and APCSA, where I learned about how the internet works, and all about java.

Large language models like ChatGPT are becoming really popular, and I want to try find ways to use AI tools to increase my productivity, without letting the AI do the work for me. OwO
